<p class="section-description">
  We are a group of people who care deeply about Severn School, and about developing an anti-racist culture there to ensure that every student feels safe, supported, and appreciated. Among us are alumni from class of 2019 back to the 1980s, 
  former faculty, and current parents. We do not have a leader or official spokesperson. Sometimes we speak as individuals and sometimes as a group.</p>
<p class="section-description">Our goal is to ensure that Severn diversifies the school, with a particular emphasis on faculty, and reforms its culture. We intend to hold the school accountable for a plan to achieve this and its implmentation. 
  We believe that this must be done with the utmost transparency, and that the leader of these efforts must be someone who will not tolerate racism in any form, and whose personal belief in creating a culture of anti-racism is sufficiently robust to impart its importance on others who may not yet believe so strongly.

<p class="section-description">
  We work through a variety of media and platforms, and welcome all who share our goal to join us in any capacity.
