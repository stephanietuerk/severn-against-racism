        We are at a critical moment. The Board has made some important concessions to our community's demand for racial justice. 
        However, we have yet to hear any response from them regarding the letters sent by Severn Community Standing Against Racism and the Severn 
        School Black Alumni Association. We need to show them that we are <strong>still</strong> engaged because <strong>the work is just beginning</strong>.

    <p class="section-description actions">This group was formed in response to a letter that Head of School Doug Lagarde shared with the Severn Community on June 3, 2020. 
        Sent at a time when American institutions from schools to corporations were communicating support for Black communities, condemning police brutality, and stating that 
        Black Lives Matter, Mr. Lagarde's email did none of these things. That his letter mentioned issues of racial injustice only as an aside made many of us very concerned 
        about the administration's commitment to Black students and to rooting out racism at the school.
    </p>
    <p class="section-description actions">
        As we connected with others, we discovered we were not alone in wanting to see Severn take a strong stand against  racism as well as other types of discrimination. 
        In response to Mr. Lagarde's letter, we wrote an open letter to the school that over 750 alumni, students, parents, and former faculty signed.
    </p>
    <p class="section-description actions">
        Through the discussions that followed Mr. Lagarde's letter and our initial response to it, we have heard more and more stories about racist and bigoted incidents 
        occurring at the school in recent years and how the administration failed to address them..  The administrationâ€™s inaction in the face of overt racism, homophobia, 
        transphobia, classism, and religious discrimination  is motivating our continued work to ensure that Severn makes real and lasting changes to support its entire 
        community. We acknowledge the steps Severn has committed to taking and we will know that its Black students matter when students and their families feel supported and 
        protected.
