Dear Headmaster Lagarde,

Severn was and continues to be an important part of who I am. However, the responses shared by you and the Board fall short during this pivotal moment in our nation's history. Your recent emails have been filled with vague and non-committal language, at a time when decisiveness and action is necessary. For example, there is no mention of the countless victims to police brutality and murder or the black lives matters movement. 

Severn, has and I assume, continues to be made up of a predominantly white and economically privileged student body. It is time that the school takes a look at itself to see how it can be part of the solution rather than continuing to be part of the problem. Not a system that supports privilege (legacy, money, etc), but rather an institution that looks to take in students from all socioeconomic backgrounds, races, and cultures. This approach will help to prepare students for the world beyond Severn, a world that is becoming more and more diverse each day. 

Waiting until the fall to have vague and noncommittal discussion about the current events is neither a timely, strong enough, nor responsible approach. The youth of this country, as we can see from the protests, are demanding change now and as an institution Severn should listen to those cries for help and enact change now. 

How is Severn changing with the times, to make sure that diversity is embraced, black and Hispanic children and youth have opportunities to become part of the fabric of the Severn community, and diversity is exemplified in all aspects of the Severn community from the student body to the Board of directors? 

The administration and board of directors should be taking to heart Severn's mission:
>Severn School challenges its students to pursue excellence in character, conduct, and scholarship, to marshal the courage to lead, and to develop the lasting desire to serve and achieve. We believe this is best realized in a community where adults model these qualities and where each student is known and valued.

If the adults in the community can not act in accordance to Severn's mission, how do you expect the children and youth to live by these words? 

Best regards,
