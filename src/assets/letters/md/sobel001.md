Mr LaGarde: 

As you are the reply to, please feel free to share this with the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees and Executive Administration. 

This is a vague commitment to action at a later date. As such, it is not enough. Let me be even more clear — I will be withholding all financial support for the school, including removal of Severn from my legacy Will and Trust planning, until actions are taken. 

The first letter was a failure to call for action. This second is the same. This gives me no confidence of addressing the problem, and as such, I have taken action in calling out for change, and will further do so with this commitment to no longer financially support the school until change is made. 

There is a right side of history. You are not on it.
