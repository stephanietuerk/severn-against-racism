Dear Headmaster Lagarde, 

First, thank you for addressing the current moment in any way. It is important for us all to use our voices at this time. Also, I understand and appreciate how difficult these letters can be to write, addressing a variety of constituencies, all with different thoughts and opinions. 

That said, I do want to express my frustration and disappointment in the content of your letter – more what you didn't say than what you did. In a time calling for conviction, for standing clearly on the side of what is right, your letter seemed carefully calibrated not to offend. Nowhere do you mention Severn’s outright support for the black community. Nowhere do you mention the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and far too many others. Nowhere do you explicitly say that Severn will stand with those looking to create change and to fight for racial justice, or note what Severn has done to date to foster a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. 

These are undeniably difficult times, and for many, excruciatingly painful, frustrating, and heart-rending times as well. As a society, we must all be better and do better. That starts with us. That includes Severn. And future communications need to spell that out – strongly and unequivocally. 

Best regards,  
EJ Crawford '95
