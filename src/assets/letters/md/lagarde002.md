Stephanie,

Sorry for the delay in responding.  Iâ€™ve been fielding many responses with a wide variety of interpretations of the letter I sent to the community. 

I appreciate and respect you opinion.  I, also, strongly believe that the best education teaches people how to think and not what to think.  That was my underlying philosophy when I wrote the letter, and it has prompted people to think, examine their biases and take action which I find wonderful and will hopefully lead to real change both at Severn and in the world at large. 

Be Well,  
Doug
