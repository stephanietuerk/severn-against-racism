Members of the Severn School Board of Trustees,

I am a white-passing person of color who graduated in 2009. I understand that the Board is meeting this week and I am writing to urge this group to take action in ensuring Severn School no longer perpetuates systemic racism or upholds white supremacy.  

**Accountability:** At June 25th’s Black Alumni Town Hall, Doug Lagarde listened to Black students tell their stories and called them “accusations”. It is clear now why these Zoom calls were not recorded, even for safekeeping in private records. An alarming number of community members have been asking for proof of instances of racism, asking our Black alumni to recount traumatic instances. The burden should not fall on Black individuals to convince a white community that racism is real. It is the responsibility of leadership to speak for these voices and to declare racism a very real issue of today (not just years past) that requires all of our attention. Racism exists even during a global pandemic.

**Leadership:** The systems responsible for oppression cannot be the same systems responsible for justice. I have heard stories of students reporting racist instances to the current administration that resulted in zero punishment of the perpetrator, and even a response of “pick your battles.” Doug Lagarde stated that he was willing to do what was needed. We cannot have a leader who is simply “willing” to do what is right. Severn School deserves a leader who is passionate about creating an antiracist culture and unequivocally supports its students who are viewed as “other.”  After witnessing Doug’s dismissal of a recent graduate’s story on the July 1 Alumni Zoom (an audible sigh heard by ~100 participants), I am convinced he is not the appropriate person to lead the next chapter.  

**Transparency:** I understand there have been discussions of creating a page on Severn’s website to detail the work being done around DEI efforts. I hope this comes to fruition as it is the best way for the school to hold itself accountable and for the community to do the same. If Severn School is truly going to commit itself to dismantling white supremacy and teaching its students to be antiracist, this should be voiced publicly and memorialized in a new Strategic Plan. 

Severn School will forever be judged by how it reacted during this significant moment in our country’s history. I urge the Board to take this seriously. This is not a Black issue that white people should empathize with; this is a white issue that white people are required to fix (especially at an elitist, majority-white private school). 

Please have the courage to lead. Own up to the racism that has been allowed to exist in the community thus far. Issue a new Strategic Plan that puts antiracist work at the center. Be transparent with the community and ask for suggestions. Listen. 

You owe it to current & future students at Severn School, but also to alumni who experienced trauma that went ignored and unaddressed, even to this very day.
