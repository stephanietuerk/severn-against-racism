Dear Mr. Lagarde -
I am extremely disturbed and disappointed to see your vague and unsatisfactory response to the murder of George Floyd and the outpouring of support for Black Lives Matter from the Severn community. You are on the wrong side of history here. Leadership means taking a stand and not allowing platitudes to do the talking. Policy making is needed - and expected.

Severn expects and deserves more from you and the Board of Directors.

A real stand against racism - a strong stand, definitive action and planning - is now required.

The time is now.

We are all watching.

Respectfully,  
Allison Prouty, Class of 1995
