Dear Mr. Lagarde and Severn Board of Trustees,

Thank you for hearing the hurt expressed by both current students and alumni, and for acknowledging that swift and decisive action is necessary during this time of racial reckoning. Your proposed changes are a good first step to addressing racism at Severn.

But that’s what they are—a first step.

I’m writing to support the additional recommendations made in the July 16th letters from the Severn School Black Alumni Association (SSBAA) and Severn Community Standing Against Racism (SCSAR). As you state, actions speak louder than words; and to that end, I’m calling on you to immediately, among other recommendations:

- Issue an apology from Mr. Lagarde for the mistreatment of BIPOC and other students under his watch

- Formally endorse the SSBAA, connect the SSBAA with current Black students, and define a role for the SSBAA in the DEI committee and Leroy Sparks Endowment Fund appropriations process

- Ensure that the DEI committee includes people who have been nominated by the SSBAA and the SCSAR. 

- Give the DEI committee a voice in the DEI Director hiring decision, and ensure that the DEI director has broad authority to enact changes

- Convene the DEI committee to revise the handbook to address hate speech and racist behaviors

Only with a firm commitment from all of us to constantly do better and do more can we reach our shared goal of creating a school where every student feels safe, valued, and supported.
