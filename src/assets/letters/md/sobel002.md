Carrie: 

Please be informed that I have removed Severn from my Will and Trust, and will be suspending any financial contributions to Severn until the school puts forth its action plan to address both the concerns cited by Alumni, but more importantly, systemic racism against the black community. 

If the school deems it willing to wait and not take action, it can wait for financial support too.
