Dear Mr. Belo,

I am reaching out to you, a Severn School trustee, as an alumna of the school who is deeply concerned about the letter that Headmaster Doug Lagarde recently sent out to the larger school community. I am not sure if you saw the initial letter, but in it, Mr. Lagarde recounted his own "struggle" with whether to say anything at all in response to this historic moment, mentioned that he had not hesitated to speak up against injustice -- I suppose elsewhere? -- in a bizarre aside, and then finished the letter without ever once condemning racism, condemning extra-judicial killings by the police, or expressing support for Severn's Black community. 

I am reaching out now as I have already sent an email to Mr. Lagarde which urged him to issue a second statement that does these things, and he has responded to me claiming that his letter is perfectly in line with his philosophy of education, and maintaining that the letter was a successful instrument of education because it has prompted a lot of people to think. My email and his response are below -- I am happy to send his original email to the Severn community if you have not already seen it.

I am working with a number of my classmates on a more public response to this. And I am extremely heartened that so many people in the alumni community feel that Severn needs to take an explicit anti-racist position and vocally affirm its support of the Black members of its community right now. 

But I also wanted to contact you directly, as likely the first Black trustee of Severn and a Diversity and Inclusion professional, to share with you how Mr. Lagarde responded. I am hoping that the Trustees may be able to impress upon Mr. Lagarde the importance of taking a definitive stance against racism, and if he is unable to do so, to have a discussion about whether he is fit to lead the school.

All the best to you in these unthinkable times,

Stephanie Tuerk
