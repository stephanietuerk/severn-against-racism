Dear Mr. Lagarde,

Thank you for sending a letter to the Severn community this week. While I know it can be difficult to find the right words to say, I wanted to write you in hopes that it might help encourage conversation about how Severn can take meaningful action, both immediate and long-term, to start combatting racism in our overwhelmingly white communities. We have an opportunity in front of us to use our privilege to create transformative change. I believe that starts with changing the curriculum at Severn, while increasing representation of people of color on staff, in leadership positions and within the student body.  

When you said in your letter that your “reticence stems from the juxtaposition of celebrating Severn’s Class of 2020 last Friday, and the celebrations of our 5th and 8th grades as they promote to Middle and Upper School,” you acknowledged that most of those students have the privilege of remaining unaware, uninvolved, or unaffected by the protests and why they were happening. Children and families of color do not have that privilege. Severn’s black students, alumni and their families will likely remember that week of graduation celebrations very differently.

I also wanted to share with you an email I received from my university alma mater, the University of Colorado, that I thought was extremely well done. I hope this can serve as a reference point for future communications to the Severn community. I learned so much from my education classes at CU. My professors taught me how to think about my privilege; how to understand systematic racism in a nation built on white supremacy; and how, if we care to dismantle those ideologies, we have to do more than just be kind and treat everyone the same. Because my classes were focused on elementary education, it also became painfully clear to me that children in poor communities are set up for failure starting in preschool and never given a fighting chance, because of the way U.S. public schools are funded to create institutionalized segregation.

These are lessons that absolutely must be taught sooner than our college years. At Severn, we learned about slavery, and we studied a select few black leaders and innovators throughout history. But we desperately needed discussions about privilege and power, so that we could learn to recognize and question our own internal biases and own our responsibility to speak up for marginalized communities. I am still baffled by the fact that these are not basic tenets of every student’s core curriculum.

I know you have read the open letter on Medium.com, but I’d like to reiterate my support for the below actions:

- Add curriculum that will require Students, Faculty and Administrators to explore what it means to be white and to deeply investigate and discuss aspects of white privilege.
- Enact policies aimed at understanding and working to undo institutional racialization of Education and Teaching.
- Expand the curriculum to accommodate deeper exploration of narratives of people of color and center more diverse coursework and study on understanding ethnic studies.
- Offer — and subsidize — expanded continuing education and educator training aimed at increasing awareness of racial microaggressions or implied bias in the classroom.
- A more formal and quantifiable commitment to diversity among Student Body, Faculty, Administration and the Board of Trustees — with publicly documented near, intermediate and long-term goals.
- A commitment to engage at the community level to directly address racism, bias and inequality beginning with scheduled and recurring conversations with community members inside and outside of the Severn family — manifested through consistent community service and volunteerism.

Please, don’t wait. You can implement much of this now — so that when students return this fall, you’re ready to have these uncomfortable but important conversations. You have the opportunity to really demonstrate what it means to marshal the courage to lead. Your current and future students depend on this, and your alumni are aching to see real change.

Thank you for taking the time to read each of these messages.

Respectfully,  
Caryn Maconi  
Severn School Class of 2009
