Dear Mr. Lagarde and Severn Board of Trustees,

Thank you for hearing the hurt expressed by both current students and alumni, and for acknowledging
that swift and decisive action is necessary during this time of racial reckoning. Your announcement last
week is a good first step to addressing racism at Severn.

In addition to the shared tenants of those listed below by the Severn School Black Alumni Association (SSBAA) and
Severn Community Standing Against Racism (SCSAR), I wanted to express some of my own personal sentiments. I
have had many conversations with alumni, many of whom are current or future parents as well as a dear friend on the
faculty and I am sad. Deeply sad.

As such, I want, so badly to say something that matters. Something that matters to the children who have been hurt,
to the current parents and alumni who don't believe there's a problem or the depth of the problem, to the board who's
position seems a secret, and to a head of a school who seems to embody this very thing, this lack of empathy that we
are fighting.

I have to admit that the 2 major reasons for my passion about this moment in time are selfish. I have a mixed-race
daughter and I am only beginning to comprehend the depth of this issue that we all face. The idea that change could
be an option at a place like Severn that is so stalwart in it its privilege made me believe that I could be hopeful. I’m
not sure that I feel as optimistic any longer. The idea that my daughter might be able to grow up in a world where
people recognize their own biases and work to improve on them and overcome them makes me willing to use my
voice and privilege in this effort. I want for her to have every opportunity that I did. And I know she will not. She will
have to work harder and smarter and be willing to turn a blind eye to things that I can’t even yet imagine.

My second motivation is a result of my experience at Severn. I was plenty popular, athletic and did well enough in
school, so I fit in nicely I’ve really only been able to articulate what was missing 25 years later. Education is not just
the acquisition of knowledge, which I acquired in spades, and am thankful for, but it is the experience we have
socially to understand other people from other lifestyles and to empathize with their worlds. This type of education
results in life pursuits that are meaningful and well-intended. While the knowledge I gained at Severn was second to
none, I left Severn with a lasting immaturity and narrowed view of the world. I loved what another Alumni said in a
post online. To paraphrase, ‘while we heard endlessly about the opportunities that we would be afforded as
graduates of Severn school, I do not ever remember anyone impressing upon me that I should take that opportunity
and with it, do good in the world.’ While the privilege is palpable at Severn, it should come with a deep understanding
of how that can create positive change in the world. “With great power comes great responsibility.” Responsibility to
yourself, your own well-being and your desire to grow as a person, responsibility to your fellow man and responsibility
to do better whenever possible. I know one of the biggest debates on hand is evaluating the capacity for an
adolescent to comprehend such a principle but hearing it more frequently and with more fervor will certainly increase
that understanding. This, in my opinion is what is most deeply lacking at Severn. The deep dive in to how these
young men and women can incorporate empathy in to their lives and the concept that they should seek to do positive
things with their privilege and not ride it out for a lifetime of ignorance or turning a blind eye.

I will say it again, ‘Education is not simply the acquisition of knowledge’, it is the culmination of how and with whom
knowledge is gained and reflected. The growth in one's self emotionally and socially and spiritually. I have little
doubt in Severn’s ability to continue to offer knowledge to its students, but what I doubt, is its ability to encourage and
demand that that knowledge be used in a manner that is productive, positive and conscious of the betterment of this
world.

Maybe I've place an inappropriate or insurmountable hope on an institution that's not up to the challenge. But I still
hope. I hope that no one ever walks out of those doors again feeling different simply because of the color of their skin. 
I hope that others like me don't get sent out in the world totally unprepared to empathize with anyone different
than themselves. And I hope that the new byproducts of this institution, so wrought with opportunity, are people who
will actively try to make this world a better place for my child and all children and people of color.

While I state my motivations for being active in this group above, I by no means want to denigrate the MOST
important factor here and that is that ALL children in a place of learning feel safe and supported, otherwise learning is
not effective or equitable.

In addition, I’m writing to support the additional recommendations made in the July 13th letters from the
Severn School Black Alumni Association (SSBAA) and Severn Community Standing Against Racism
(SCSAR). As you state, actions speak louder than words; and to that end, I’m calling on you to
immediately, among other recommendations:

- Issue an apology from Mr. Lagarde for the mistreatment of BIPOC and other students
under his watch
- Formally endorse the SSBAA, connect the SSBAA with current Black students, and
define a role for the SSBAA in the DEI committee and Leroy Sparks Endowment Fund
appropriation process
- Ensure that the DEI committee includes people who have been nominated by the SSBAA
and the SCSAR.
- Give the DEI committee a voice in the DEI Director hiring decision, and ensure that the
DEI director has broad authority to enact changes
- Convene the DEI committee to revise the handbook to address hate speech and racist
behaviors

Only with a firm commitment from all of us to constantly do better and do more can we reach our shared
goal of creating a school where every student feels safe, valued, and supported.
Kind Regards,

Julie Tice ‘96
