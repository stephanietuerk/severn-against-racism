Dear Severn, 

It is with great sadness that I hereby renounce my 2009 induction into the Severn School Athletic Hall of Fame. As we seek our place in this pivotal time, I am overwhelmed with disappointment and despair in admitting I cannot associate my myself with the ideology and behavior of Severn School’s failed leadership. I request the school cease associating my name with this athletic distinction in any capacity. 

In the past weeks I have learned of an institution that has grown increasingly toxic, suppressing diversity, suppressing teacher voices, and failing to provide a safe and just environment for students. I’ve also heard far too many troubling stories of neglect from fellow alumni recounting their time at school and returning to campus. The school lacks the type of character and leadership that I wish to associate with myself and how I intend to walk in this world. 

I applaud the hundreds of fellow alumni, past and current parents, and students that have stood together against racism. I hope one day to believe in Severn’s ability to stand with us. 

I will turn my attention to the incredible teammates, coaches, teachers and administrators who shaped the person I am today. I owe so much to all of them and have never done a sufficient job of letting them know. 

I will also continue to support the ongoing efforts to reform Severn. In a place of integrity, trust and honesty, I see myself addressing the student body as to why I took this position and why it was important to me and the future of the school. A courageous school with strong leadership will welcome me back with open arms. That is not the Severn School of today.

I have consulted no one in coming to this place and this decision. It is mine and mine alone. However, I have never felt more connected to my fellow alumni than I do today, and 

I thank them for giving me the strength to stand against racism. We can be better, and we must do better. The work continues.

Sincerely,  
Josh Sims
