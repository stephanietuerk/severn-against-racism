To Severn Board of Trustees and Head of School Lagarde:

Thank you for acknowledging that Severn School can do better and do more on diversity, equity and inclusion, and thank you for taking the first steps in that direction. We're encouraged by your stated commitment to effect change, yet the administration's history of obfuscation and inaction in this area stops us short of enthusiasm. As you have stated, your actions will speak louder than words as we move forward.

In the coming days, we’re particularly seeking assurance that the proposed committee will include members who are committed to ensuring that the school meets, even exceeds, its diversity goals. We believe that the committee should comprise at least three members from each stakeholder category, with alumni who span the decades. Provided at the end of this letter is a list of alumni, parents, and faculty who have a clear vision of an inclusive and anti-racist Severn. To harness the incredible energy of this group, we ask you to consider our nominations, especially members of the Severn School Black Alumni Association (SSBAA), in committee selections.

We’re also mindful that a DEI Director should help develop policies that support the school’s new goals. However, we believe that it is imperative for Severn to begin the ‘20-’21 school year with some of those policies firmly in place. As it is mid-July, we’re concerned about the short time horizon to both hire a DEI director and develop policies establishing a new tone for the school and protecting students who are still grappling with past trauma. 

In the spirit of continuing to do better and do more, we're calling on you to add these critical items to your action plan.

**Near-Term Actions**  
- The Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee should be convened immediately to: 
  - **Hire the DEI Director.** Much of Severn’s evolution will hinge on the ability of the new DEI Director to implement changes and work with the DEI Committee, to whom they will report. The successful candidate will be someone in whom the entire DEI Committee has the utmost confidence and who is empowered with broad authority to effectuate changes. The DEI Committee should have a voice in this crucial hiring decision.
  - **Revise the 2020-2021 handbook to address hate speech and racist behaviors**, with clearly defined examples and disciplinary action. The Committee should investigate possibilities for third party oversight of incident reporting and routine surveying of the student, teacher and faculty populations against which to baseline and measure progress.
  - Discuss the responsibilities, goals, and scope of the Committee, including member terms and transitions. **The Committee should grant the SSBAA involvement in the appointment of future DEI Committee members.**
 
- Upon formal announcement of the DEI Team, **call an emergency meeting of the Committee with the full Board of Trustees** to address concerns raised by the SSBAA in its July 13, 2020, letter, including, but not limited to:
  - **An apology from Head of School Doug Lagarde** acknowledging his role in allowing mistreatment of BIPOC, LGBTQ, and students of different socioeconomic backgrounds to occur, and sharing with the community what he is doing to learn to be a better ally. All of us are more interested in looking ahead than revisiting past wrongs; but healing cannot begin without an apology, especially as a number of people have lost confidence in his ability to spearhead meaningful change. We ask that Mr. Lagarde lead the school’s growth by demonstrating his personal growth.
  - **A formal endorsement of the SSBAA** via email and in the next printed publication of The Bridge, along with an announcement of its involvement in both the DEI Team and appropriation of funds for the Leroy Sparks Endowment Fund.
  - **A means for current Black students to connect with members of the SSBAA**, such as a virtual meeting with Black students once a quarter to discuss issues of race and the antiracist progress that has been made.

    In the interest of transparency, we believe that the minutes from this meeting should be made publicly available. 

**Longer-Term Actions**
- Issue a new Strategic Plan. “Diversity” isn’t mentioned until the fourth page in the current plan and the Globalism/Diversity Initiatives are on the last page. A new Strategic Plan should emphasize teaching students about their privilege and how to utilize it to enact positive change. This plan needs to contain initiatives of substance with real, achievable goals.
- Increase transparency of the diversity statistics of faculty and students. This accountability structure will allow the community to track the school’s progress against stated goals. Matriculation information of BIPOC should also be provided. 
- Implement a mandatory, semester-long course on race in America.

We have a mutual goal for Severn School to be a place where every student feels safe, valued, and supported; with commitment, hard work, and open minds, we believe that we can get there. We look forward to working collaboratively with you on this urgent effort.

Sincerely,  
Severn Community Standing Against Racism
