Good afternoon,

I am an alum from the class of '95. I am writing to voice my concern about the letter that was sent out to the Severn community in reference to police brutality and racism. The letter starkly reminded me of Donald Trump's comment about "Fine people on both sides" in reference to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. This is not a time to be ambiguous and lend credibility to abuses of power and systemic racism. It is a time for clear and courageous leadership to say and do the right thing, which is to acknowledge that black lives matter. It is not needed or helpful to couch a reluctance to take a stand on this issue in the rhetoric of people making their own decision or judgment on this matter. Human beings will always have their opinions, but educators are supposed to guide our youth to understand the difference between right and wrong, oppression and liberty, safety and terror.

Thank you,  
Charlotte Byrd, LCSW-C, Severn class of '95
