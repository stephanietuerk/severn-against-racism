To: Severn School Board of Trustees and Doug Lagarde

Black alumni have recently joined together to create the Severn School Black Alumni Association (SSBAA). Our mission is to strengthen the legacy of excellence of Severn's Black students and provide support to current Black students, families, and alumni through networking, mentorship, volunteer involvement, philanthropy and social enterprise. In response to your July 6, 2020 letter, we have the following requests:
- Parents and students should be aware of the SSBAA and that its members are resources for personal and professional help. We are requesting a dedicated space on the Severn Alumni
- Webpage as well as on the Severn Connect portal, and an announcement on all Severn School Alum social media channels.
- We would like representation on the proposed DEI Team. 
- We expect Severn School to facilitate opportunities for current Black students to connect with Black alumni. Opportunities such as Black history month, open house, college night, homecoming, and back to school night will foster networking opportunities for Black students and alumni to network.
- We would like to partner in diversifying the current curriculum. 
- We want to see increased visibility and promotion of The Leroy Sparks Endowment. In addition, provide more visibility and promotion for all scholarships and endowments to include the application process and deadlines for submission. 
- We would like Severn to review and develop additional resources beyond tuition to increase retention of current and future Black Severn students.  
- During the townhall meetings, Black alumni were apprised of several racist instances and mistreatments of LGBTQ+, BIPOC students and families from different socioeconomic backgrounds. We implore Severn to ensure their immediate and long term efforts are inclusive of the aforementioned groups as well. 

We look forward to working with our Severn family to assist in discovering new pathways for helping Severn students experience, understand, and embrace diversity, equity, and inclusion; while, learning to become and build their best young selves. We hope that as Black Severn alumni we can guide our Severn family to seek out new possibilities of expression, learning, and discovery. This is our promise and opportunity to answer the call for action and answer the question, “Are we a diverse, equitable, and inclusive Severn family?”

Sincerely,  
Severn School Black Alumni Association
