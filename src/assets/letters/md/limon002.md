Hi Carrie,

I found your email on the Severn Connect website, do you run the @severnschoolalums Instagram handle? I would love to see some support for (or even acknowledgement of) the Black Lives Matter movement. As a predominately white community, Severn has a duty to make it abundantly clear that it denounces all forms of discrimination and call its community members to action in the fight against racism.

I’ve had many conversations with fellow grads who share my disappointment in the lack of a public post. Is there a reason why nothing has been said?
The parent of a Lower School student shared Doug’s email to the community with me and while I was initially shocked at the reasoning for his reticence, I think it still provides content that could be shared via social media. This passage in particular is extremely powerful and inspiring:

>The choice not to act is itself an act...if you have the opportunity to make your voice heard, you should rightfully feel bad when you fail to do so.

Is controversy trying to be avoided by explicitly denouncing systemic racism, reaffirming that black lives matter, or saying the names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner and so many more? I’m truly trying to understand the reasoning. Like Doug said in his letter, I’m asking the difficult questions, seeking answers, and acting.

I am inspired by graduates of Notre Dame Prep who recently joined together to gather over 1,000 signatures in two days, demanding a public statement and actionable steps including curriculum and personnel changes. Linked [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11etlLPt28NvDZ3NeDnYpQoyh-Wk9dsKiYG_N-rG6jl4/edit?fbclid=IwAR0o1_IZF-e_EzMht_CxAxSAT9Y3rzJm2ixeiW52RySN9Cqw5ZxZs6PnOCw) is their letter. The resulting statement from their Headmistress is [HERE](https://www.notredameprep.com/about-ndp/inclusivity-at-ndp?fbclid=IwAR0kW_3Ht2AVSI3XRshfSCrkeEUrg3u_WH4NQXVEmviS9TRtEM1Uh0ZtK4w). Certainly Severn won’t require a formal petition and signatures from its community before taking action.

I would love to hear from you (or if I have the wrong person, sorry for bothering and please point me in the right direction...I've also been trying to contact Severn's Facebook page to no avail).
