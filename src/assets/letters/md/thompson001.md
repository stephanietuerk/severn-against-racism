Good Morning Doug,

I really hope this email finds you well. I will keep my response brief, and leave the line of communication open if you would like to speak further. First, I would like to thank you for your email and notice of Severn School’s stance on character building and racial injustices.

As a former student, and more specifically a student of color—a black student, I am disappointed in the lack of solidarity that Severn School has chosen to take in regards to not forming a specific stance on the support of black lives. The email was extremely vague and seemed so “politically correct” that it contradicted itself.

You mentioned the importance of character, but what, truly, is Severn School’s character? What are the morals in which the backbone of Severn School stand? Does Severn School believe black lives matter? Would Severn rather take the stance of All lives matter?

By generally mentioning the importance of character and taking action, juxtaposes the importance of someone standing up for the marginalized community of black people. This is not a time to declare neutrality—especially when black people are so blatantly being murdered and martyred by those ‘sworn to protect and serve’ these very people.

I understand and agree that every single person on this earth matters; however, without acknowledging and challenging the systemic racism and prejudice this country is built on and Severn School’s Independent System has benefited from, black lives don’t matter.

Historically, the regard for black lives (or even the history of black lives) has not mattered or been truly appreciated or acknowledged in this country. For you to not acknowledge your stance at all, you remain part of the problem, and not the solution. Neutrality reinforces the systemic  oppression that has brought us here.

Until your white privilege is used to make a public statement that black lives actually matter to the Severn School community, and that you stand with the importance of black lives, we cannot believe the Severn community ever cared about us. 

With Love & Hope for Justice & Peace,
