Dear Headmaster Lagarde,

I am writing to let you know that I was shocked that this letter was sent out to the larger Severn community, including alumni such as myself, during this week in history. 

As I am sure you are aware, this is a historic moment during which America's systemic racism and mistreatment of Black Americans is finally bring brought to the forefront of our collective consciousness as Americans, regardless of our individual races. I have received emails from the heads each university I have received a degree from, the CEO of my current employer, organizations whose newsletters I have signed up from, a number of merchants from whom I bought $20 worth of goods from at some point in the last five years, and restaurants whose wifi networks I once logged into, all of whom were able to share in no uncertain terms that they believe that Black Lives Matter, and to condemn police brutality, particularly as it affects Black people in this country. 

In contrast, Severn has made the choice to send this letter, which vaguely speaks of "character" and leadership, and then focuses on a white man's inner debate of whether or not to say something at all during this unprecedented time. Although you say that you haven't hesitated to condemn injustice, this letter in fact never condemns injustice, never says that Severn supports the Black members of its community, and never acknowledges the unique struggles that Black people face, particularly at Severn, which for years has been less diverse than the larger community in which it is situated.

(I am an alum and wanted to better understand Severn today, so went and read reviews of the schools on several high school review sites, and was saddened to see that nearly all of the reviews that spoke critically of the school focused on a lack of diversity and support for minority students, and in some cases, racist remarks among students.) 

It is not too late for Severn to issue an additional statement that demonstrates an understanding of the systemic racism that white Americans perpetrate, sometimes knowingly but often unknowingly, on Black Americans (as well as other Americans of color), and Severn's desire to show leadership in stemming this, particularly in its own community. I realize that this would break with Severn's long tradition of frankly conservative politics on race, but isn't that the point of this moment? To show leadership and actually change this systemic racism? At the very least it is hard for me to understand why, if Severn's goal is primarily to prepare students for college, Severn would not want to take this issue as seriously as the universities that its students will soon attend are. I am happy to forward the letters I have received from MIT, Yale, and Stanford if you would like to see examples of how other educational institutions, for whom this time also coincides with graduation, are responding.

In summary, I sincerely hope that Severn is able to make a second statement to its community that states in no uncertain terms its support for Black members of its community, and its commitment to dismantling racism. 

Sincerely,

Stephanie Tuerk
